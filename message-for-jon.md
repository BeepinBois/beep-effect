Hey Jon — I saw your post in the Effect Discord and this maps directly to work I’ve been doing.

I’m an Effect-heavy engineer (8 years total; last 2 building a WMS from scratch at e2.solutions) and have shipped production policy/rule systems with Effect: multi-step workflows (picking, moving, adjusting), dynamic Drizzle queries, and an MCP-backed schema layer for LLM-powered querying.

Why I’m a strong fit for your v1
- Review & build: I’ve built a policy-as-data / rules stack with a typed DSL, validators, and runtime adapters you can run now.
- Testing strategy: JSON Schema (Ajv) shape validation + semantic validation + scenario tests at the workflow level; unit tests on rule evaluation. Comfortable with @effect/vitest where needed.
- Layering/DI/error handling/observability: Use Effect Layers for boundary adapters, keep policies pure/data-first, instrument evaluation with auditors and DOT graph visualizations for fast debugging.
- Visibility: Audit trail of fact insertions/rule firings; human-readable logs; exportable DOT graph of rule networks.
- Authoring UI (optional): I’ve built a JSONForms-based step builder with typed schemas and guard/transition helpers. Easy to extend into a policy authoring UI & DevEx.

Concrete pieces you can review
- Typed workflow DSL (Effect Schema → JSON Schema 2020-12)
  - apps/web/src/features/form-system/dsl/typed.ts (export: createTypedWorkflow, typed JsonLogic helpers like varAnswers/varExternal/eq/and/or/not)
  - Validations: apps/web/src/features/form-system/validation/schema.ts (Ajv 2020), validation/semantic.ts (reachability, duplicates, terminal path)
  - Runtime: apps/web/src/features/form-system/runtime/xstateAdapter.ts (buildMachine, priorities, RUN actors, BACK, snapshot/load), runtime/jsonLogicEvaluator.ts
  - Demo: apps/web/src/app/form-demo/page.tsx (actor-based fetch, step validation gating NEXT, inspectable machine, snapshot persistence)
- Rete-based rules engine (policy network)
  - packages/common/rete/src/core/beep.ts (engine API: insert/retract, rule(...).enact({ when/then/thenFinally }), query/subscribe, perf(), dotFile())
  - packages/common/rete/src/network/audit.ts (Auditor + consoleAuditor for structured, colorized tracing)
  - packages/common/rete/src/network/* (join/alpha/memory nodes; query, subscribe, fire; DOT viz)
- Effect layering/DI example
  - packages/shared/client/src/services/common/layerIndexedDB.ts (Layer-provided KeyValueStore adapter with Platform errors, scoped resource, finalizers)

How I’d help you land production-grade, real-time, policy-as-data
- Data model & persistence: versioned, data-first policy/rule schema; JSON Schema for authoring/validation; DB-backed (no caching) evaluation inputs/outputs.
- Runtime & evaluation: typed rule guards (JsonLogic or DSL → compiled), priority ordering, deterministic transitions; actor-style side effects with observable results.
- Instrumentation: auditor hooks for rule/fact flow; DOT exports; structured logs; hooks for metrics/tracing.
- Testing: schema validity, semantic integrity, property-style and scenario tests for transitions, golden outputs for complex policies.
- DevEx: authoring UI (JSONForms), preview & dry-runs, developer logs and graph viz built in.

If this aligns with what you’re building, I’d love to help finish the implementation and shape the final form. I’m happy to start with a short, scoped engagement (review → plan → delivery) and move quickly.

Thanks for reading — looking forward to chatting!
